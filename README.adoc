Hermes is a background process on the Solar Car's Dashboard Pi.
It reads in bytestream data from the Embedded systems via serial port and translates it to human readable JSON.

== Connecting to Serial Ports

=== Serial Port
In the config.ini file, there is a  `SerialPort` section:
```
[SerialPort]
portName=/dev/pts/7
baudrate=115200
```
* `portName` - path to the serial port
** On debian based distros, physical devices can be found in `/dev/`, e.g `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
* `baudrate` - the rate the information is sent
** Ensure that both ends of communication have the same baudrate.
