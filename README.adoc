Core Universal Netflow Transformer Update
Hermes Architecture has undergone a major update to simplify and streamline the process of data transfer from embedded systems to the dashboard and telemetry site. Making it easier to modify and add new packets to our data stream.

Hermes is a background process on the Solar Car's Dashboard Pi.
It reads in bytestream data from the Embedded systems via serial port and translates it to human readable JSON.

== Connecting to Serial Ports

=== Serial Port
In the config.ini file, there is a  `SerialPort` section:
```
[SerialPort]
portName=/dev/pts/7
baudrate=115200
```
* `portName` - path to the serial port
** On debian based distros, physical devices can be found in `/dev/`, e.g `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
* `baudrate` - the rate the information is sent
** Ensure that both ends of communication have the same baudrate.
